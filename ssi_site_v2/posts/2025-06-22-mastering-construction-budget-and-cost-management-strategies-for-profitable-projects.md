### Key Elements of an Effective Construction Budget

1. **Detailed Cost Estimation**

   * **Overhead:** General business expenses proportionally allocated to the project.
   * **Contingency funds:** Typically 5â€“20% of total costs for unexpected events.
   * **Escalation allowance:** Covers price increases in labor or materials over time.
2. **Clear Scope Definition**

   * Avoid scope creep by engaging all stakeholders early to define deliverables and expectations.
