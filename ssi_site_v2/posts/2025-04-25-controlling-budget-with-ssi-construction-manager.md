Once you have created budget in the Execute tab, transfer it by clicking transfer to budget button at the bottom right corner of Divisional breakdown table. Move over to control and monitor tab and verify the budget under the budget tab. All of your division codes have been used as cost codes. These cost codes are very important when signing contract and linking them in the PO tab. Make sure you use the same cost code that is listed in the budget to link a purchase order to that budget. Again, same thing for the Invoice tab, make sure you use the same cost code as PO/Contract for the invoice to link it to that particular PO. Cost code is the link between them all, so make sure to use the right cost code. Attach you contact documents in the PO tab and invoices in the Invoice tab for easy reference  in the future. Remember, the link is a path to your file on your computer only. If you delete the file or move the file from the folder it is linked from, you will not be able to open it.
