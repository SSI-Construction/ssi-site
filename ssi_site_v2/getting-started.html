    <p class='mb-4'>🎙️ Opening</p>
<p class='mb-4'>Hi, and welcome to SSI Construction Manager — the most valuable tool for construction managers who want to simplify their project schedule and finances and stay in control.</p>
<p class='mb-4'>🛠️ Create or Open a Project</p>
<p class='mb-4'>To get started, create a new project by adding project ID and project name or open an existing one.
Each project has its own budget, purchase orders, invoices, schedule and reports — all neatly organized and separated.</p>
<p class='mb-4'>💼 Budget Setup</p>
<p class='mb-4'>Start in Execute tab, Under the Divisional Breakdown tab, enter your costs by CSI Master Format divisions.
Divisions are already preloaded for you, and you can easily adjust unit rates and quantities. Click Save division data before closing the application or switching between projects.
As you build your budget, the app calculates division totals automatically. Do not make any entries in the divisional total table. Enter your soft cost in the soft cost table. All totals will be summarized in the total project cost table in the summary tab. Once your budget is complete, click the transfer to budget button at the bottom right of the divisional total table. Your division number becomes your cost code in the budget table under control and monitor tab’s budget tab.</p>
<p class='mb-4'>📑 Purchase Orders</p>
<p class='mb-4'>Next, generate purchase orders directly from your budget lines. Make sure to use the correct cost code for your PO cost to connect to the budget values.
Each PO is entered by cost code, vendor name, and amount.
You can even attach files like quotes or supplier documents for future reference. A link to your existing file in the project folder is created. Do not delete or move the file from the folder once the link is created.</p>
<p class='mb-4'>💳 Invoices</p>
<p class='mb-4'>The Invoice tab lets you log incoming invoices and match them to their POs.
This helps track what’s been billed, and what’s still outstanding. Again, use the correct cost code to connect it to the PO and the budget. Attach your invoice to the attachment. A link to your existing file in the project folder is created. Do not delete or move the file from the folder once the link is created.</p>
<p class='mb-4'>📊 Reports</p>
<p class='mb-4'>At any time, generate PDF reports for your client or team.
The system compiles your budget, PO, invoice, over/under, and cost to finish in exportable formats. PDF generated in Execute tab will export divisional data, division summary table, soft cost table and total project cost table. PDF generated in the Control and Monitor tab will export you budget, po, invoice, over/under, cost to finish summary along with the budget table, po table, and the invoice table.</p>
<p class='mb-4'>📅 Schedule Tab</p>
<p class='mb-4'>SSI Construction Manager includes a built-in Schedule tab, where you can create clean, professional-looking project schedules.
You can organize tasks, set dates, and build a look-ahead timeline to help keep your team and finances aligned. If you want task to update automatically, use the depend on ID to connect your tasks. If you would like the task to be scheduled manually, leave the depend on ID blank. Click save schedule before changing projects or tabs.</p>
<p class='mb-4'>🎯 Wrap Up</p>
<p class='mb-4'>SSI Construction Manager was built by builders — for builders.
If you're ready to take control of your construction finances and schedule, download it now from the Microsoft Store and try it for yourself. Don’t forget to drop review, comments, and suggestions. This is a one time fee application with all data being saved locally on your desktop so no monthly fees. Depending on the demand and requests, we will implement web application with monthly fee with access from multiple devices, but will allways keep the stand alone option available.</p>
